Complex Counting Game

A beginner-friendly Python counting game project




This is my first Python game and also my first GitHub project. Development was assisted by AI, and appropriate credit is given.

Requirements

Visual Studio Code (recommended)

Python 3.x (the game currently runs in the terminal)


Planned Features

[ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI)

[ ] Add a calculator game mode

[ ] Include full project credits in the source code

[ ] Release version 1.0

[ ] Move on to new Python projects after version 10.0


Notes

Future updates will expand functionality and improve the overall experience.

After version 10.0 is released, development on this game will stop.
